CRITICAL WOMAN:

the mask you wear is loose
THEY will come close and rip it right off.

what's under it?
you're not extraodinary, you're not ordinary, not even average, just meh.

[A woman sits in a chair]
[she's popping crisps into her mouth]
[Crunch crunch crunch]
[She flips a magazine]
[Sucks the grease off her finger]
[she eats, she flips magazine pages sharp sharp sharp flip flip flip]
[nais red and sharp] 
[she pops another crisp into her mouth]
[crunch crunch crunch]
[sucks the grease off her finger]

The world I was born into was
an inbetween place
was an escape.
A fight and flight response;
[she flips magazines][sucks her finger]
[wiggles her angle][her heel starts to fall]
[exposes bare heel]

And We landed HERE and never left
[magazine pages flip]
though we want to.
This is NOT the place
because you are never really home.
There is no home only rest stops
where you wipe your privates clean,
reapply deodorant,
[she pops another crisp into her mouth]
change your shoes.
[crunch]

At the next one you can change your clothes
[she flips the page][rolls her eyes][jiggles ankle]
[her shoe falls off]

If the next stop is cleaner or at least not wet around the sink
you'll wash your face and reapply your makeup.

Start with concealor end with blush: that's FACE.
EYES: eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara
LIPS: now, the key is to blend colors. It will always be the same color. Regardless of the RGB values.
It will always be red.
[she sucks the grease off her finger]
[she puts her foot back into the shoe][scratches her ankle]

Red. You know what for.
You here that knock?
This place is unfortunately public.
THEY don't usually knock. THEY want to get in.
Danger is always around. Floating in the air like a mosquito.
Danger is HERE at this rest stop at all the stops.
Stand still too long and you'll get bitten.
[magazine pages flip]

The key is fight and fly
to the next one before it comes

and you better be ready
you better be fresh.
[woman takes the last crisp][she crumples the bag]

It's an inbetween place
where I'm from.
We're not used to staying in any place 
as ourselves for too long
