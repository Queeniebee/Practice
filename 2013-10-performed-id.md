WOMAN 1

The world I was born into was
an inbetween place,
a fight and flight response.

And we landed HERE and never left
though we want to.
This is NOT the place
because you are never really home.
There is no home only rest stops
where you wipe your privates clean,
reapply deodorant,
change your shoes.

If the next stop is not as wet around the sink
you'll wash your face and reapply your makeup.

Start with concealor end with blush: that's FACE.
EYES: eyeliner, primer, eyeshadow, mascara
LIPS: now, do not use just one lipstick, the key is to blend colors. 
It will always be the same color. Regardless of the RGB values.
It will always be red.

Burgundy, wine, plum. Red. 
You better be ready, you better be fresh.
You hear that knock?
This place is unfortunately public.
THEY don't usually knock. THEY want to get in.

The mask you wear is flimsy: the foundation too sheer, the lip color off
The mask you wear is loose.
THEY will come up to you tangy and erect and snatch it right off.
And they'll see YOU. And then what'll you do?

[laughs]
You thought you could start a table?
You thought that they would swarm around you nice and soft
and sit next to you, chat with you, like you? 
Believe you?
After all this time
you thought that you could
be the sugar between the flies and the fruit?

Huh.
(your pock marks detail a thousand lifetimes)
(shapeshifter)
They'll see YOU as you are.
Just wide and…
not extraordinary, not ordinary, not even average:
Meh.
Meh.

WOMAN 2

Danger is always around. Floating in the air like a mosquito.
Danger is HERE at this rest stop at all the stops.
Stand still too long and you'll get bitten.

The key is fight and fly
to the next one before it comes

and you better be ready
you better be fresh.

I’ll push this one to be smart because looking the way she does it’ll be harder

but huh, smart cookie you turned out to be

it’s an inbetween place where I’m from

(sometimes THEY are blood)
the mask you wear is flimsy.
THEY will come up to you and snatch it right off.
And then what’ll you do?
not extraordinary, not ordinary, not average: but Meh.
Meh.

(I am the girl who sits alone because no one sits by me
I am the girl who doesn't attract the crowd.
I can't start a table.)

------------

then you see it’s the same wet patterns around the sink
the pools of water are shaped in the same amoeba shapes.
the pink liquid soap remains/stays at the same fill line
the trash overflows with used paper towels the same way.

you travelled
same space.
you travelled
same space different place

You bring it with you.
All the dirt and the gunk and the hair,
you bring it with you.

You thought you were a shapeshifter?
Morph into something 

(I don't want to be this explicit)
this isn’t the place but i’m always here.
you bring it with you.

you can't be new, you can't be new
but you can be…not pretty but smart--well (so literal)
[she shrugs and turns away] 

-------

my mother had these black boots
plain boots that probably came up just below her knees.
did they have heels.
during saturday morning cartoons i would put them on and prance around the living room
there’s a picture of me.
they came all the way up up up
i loved the smell and feel of them.

three women
  >>the critical woman
  >>the half-woman
  >>me in the room

—In a room:
  >>New Haven AND Minneapolis AND Floral Park

change clothes to signal change of character
  >>a suit, preferably red, for the CRITICAL WOMAN; high patent heels
  >>HALF-WOMAN the purple tank, leggings, boots, either the fetish boots or other over-knee boots with a heel; or tall boots with thigh-high socks;
    >>if I use the socks that means no black leggings; long gloves
  >>ME-IN-THE-ROOM::shoeless and gloveless, I put clothes on and off.

The world I was born into was
an inbetween place

A fight and flight response;
[she flips magazines][sucks her finger]
[wiggles her angle][her heel starts to fall]
[exposes bare heel]

And We landed HERE and never left
[magazine pages flip]
though we want to.
This is NOT the place

[she pops another crisp into her mouth]
change your shoes.
[crunch]

At the next one you can change your clothes
[she flips the page][rolls her eyes][jiggles ankle]
[her shoe falls off]

If the next stop is cleaner or at least not wet around the sink
you'll wash your face and reapply your makeup.

Start with concealor end with blush: that's FACE.
EYES: eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara
LIPS: now, the key is to blend colors. It will always be the same color. Regardless of the RGB values.
It will always be red.
[she sucks the grease off her finger]
[she puts her foot back into the shoe][scratches her ankle]

Red. You know what for.
You here that knock?
This place is unfortunately public.
THEY don't usually knock. THEY want to get in.

to the next one before it comes

and you better be ready

[woman takes the last crisp][she crumples the bag]

It's an inbetween place
where I'm from.
We're not used to staying in any place 
as ourselves for too long
