* Synch Serial Communication
Clk -> Clk
[same three as Asynch]

* Logic
either true or false logic

* Binary of ASCII
serial communication will be sent/received in either

* Formatting the data from the serial port
Punctuation
Call/Response

WIRELESS COMMUNICATION
======================
<dl>
<dt>Infared</dt>
<dd>Good for pointing</dd>

<dt>Radio Frequency</dt>
<dd>Go a greater distance than infared</dd>

NFC: near field communication
--don't need contact, those tap cards, tracking systems

use can use cellphone networks: GSM shields
there is also bluetooth
	bluetooth modules are actually *modems*; a modem is a device that translates one form a communication data to antoher
	there are two modes: command and data mode

Speaking to XBee in CoolTerm

ATMY: what's your ID number
ATWR: memory
ATDL: end point/destination:
