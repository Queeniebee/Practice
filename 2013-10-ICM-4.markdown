#### More on For Loops

_you type functions like you type variables;_ 
    >>Think about what type of TYPE you want/need to return

to decelerate you need to multiply by less than one
to accelerate you need to multiply by more than one

*you can only return one type-thing from a function*

whenever you want to make code into functions, the items that change should be arguments.
