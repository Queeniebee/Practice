### ICM Week 7 (or maybe 8)

loadFont() is create a font
createFont() is to load a font
(i know!!!)

textFont() accepts an instance of the PFont class
textSize()
textAlign() accepts CENTER, etc values, x-coord and y-coord

text() accepts an instance of String, second and third params are x-coords and y-coords

remember remember:: the input of .split() is an instance of String, the output is an instance of Array

Dictionaries or Dicts
there is something called concordance

a hash map:: an arbitrary objects as key,value pairs

you can call the .keyArray() on a concordance object, it will only return the keys, the words not frequency which are the values.

in Dictionaries the Key assumes a string

*then we covered JSON*
