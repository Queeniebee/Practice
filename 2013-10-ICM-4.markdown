### ICM Week 7 (or maybe 8)

loadFont() is create a font
createFont() is to load a font
(i know!!!)

textFont() accepts an instance of the PFont class
textSize()
textAlign() accepts CENTER, etc values, x-coord and y-coord

text() accepts an instance of String, second and third params are x-coords and y-coords

remember remember:: the input of .split() is an instance of String, the output is an instance of Array

Dictionaries or Dicts
there is something called concordance

a hash map:: an arbitrary objects as key,value pairs

you can call the .keyArray() on a concordance object, it will only return the keys, the words not frequency which are the values.

in Dictionaries the Key assumes a string

*then we covered JSON*

#### More on For Loops

_you type functions like you type variables;_ 
    >>Think about what type of TYPE you want/need to return

to decelerate you need to multiply by less than one
to accelerate you need to multiply by more than one

*you can only return one type-thing from a function*

whenever you want to make code into functions, the items that change should be arguments.
