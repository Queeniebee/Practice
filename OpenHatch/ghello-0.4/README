This is stump's take on the usual GTK+ Hello World program, intended to
serve as an example project tarball for OpenHatch's training missions.
This program is placed into the public domain.

You need the GTK+ development files (libgtk2.0-dev under Debian) to
build the program, but you don't need to build the program to complete
the mission.
