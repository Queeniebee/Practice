# Day 1

? openssl was in Jeff's library ?

loading an image will be very similar to loading a video

the project generator will make a relative path, but still
** your project should be three levels from main oF folder APPS**

the main thing is that the XCodeproject is *THREE* levels from root**

Wha? ==> the only this the computer knows how to draw is a triangle.

ofSetCircleResolution(int) ==> adds more points to smooth it out to look less jaggered.

use floats! use floats! when dealing with position/coordinates

the update() function is constantly updating the data, doing the math
the draw() funciton just draws your images to the screen
<dl>
<dt>your update function is using your CPU</dt>
<dt>your draw function is using your GPU</dt>
</dl>

Our applications (I forgot what this was going to be)

#### All class variables and functions should be defined in the Header file!! 

## Do not pollute the global variable scope

Another name for the .cpp file is the _implementation_ file.

when you use n++ it first uses the value of n
++n increments first so uses the value n+1 first

both oF and Processing use the *painters algo* ==> the last thing you draw is on the top

HW is to figure out how to apply painter's algo in the mouse sketch

remember, remember we want to simply DRY out code

Don't use Constructors, use a function called Setup within your own cpp/h files
