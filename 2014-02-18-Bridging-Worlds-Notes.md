Peripheral Display
==================

According to the paper assigned, a successful display must suppor the following characteristics

* abstraction
```
goal is to reduce the fidelity of information so that it is easier to read "at a glance"
```
use of color, sound, coded images like sexuality, violence

* notification levels
```
refer to difference of information importance
also the arrival of new information
```
> 5 notification levels
ignore ==> display is off
change blind ==> info of marginal impt
make aware
interrupt
demand action

* transitions
```

```

### Balance to Strike
Frequency of occurance affects expectation

If a notification is not expected it can lead to a surprise/astonishment which when designing experiences is a phenomenon to be minimized

People habituate to periodic stimuli

Loud noises while attention

* Beware of raising noise floor when you don't intend to.
