# Debugging Techniques

**Always hit CMD-T ==> it formats the code

* Commenting out line by line

* Write Comments for what you _want to do_.

* Draw out animation frame by frame

* Break it out into smaller sketch

* Print out your values

* Find a human and walk them through what _want to do_.

Processing/Java has BLOCK SCOPE. (and remember, remember JavaScript has function scope)
<dl>
<dt>state buttons</dt>
<dl>For state stuff you need another variable usually a Boolean that tracks the state. Check out the bouncing ball example on the class site.</dt>
<dt>toggle buttons</dt>
