*Gentrification of the Mind: Witness to a Lost Imagination* by Sarah Schulman

An image that has stayed with me since reading Sarah Schulman's *Gentrification of the Mind* is the description of black plastic bags outside on the streets of Chelsea. Schulman's book is a merge between memoir and sociology thesis, exploring the social and political mechanisms behind New York City's rapid gentrification and who and what was erased or left to rot.

From Penny Arcade:
I often hear yuppies say that 

Schulman links the AIDS crisis to gentrification.
