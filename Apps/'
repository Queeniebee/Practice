*Twigg*
early in Twitter API
real-time Public Social Data

processed the URLS that people were sharing in realtime
later expanded to Facebook

Another tool: *Montage*
type a word in and create a document (I didn't know about this!!)

From Montage *So.cl* was born

Social Networks were once developed as walled gardens, ie Facebook
now they are aiming to integrate into the web

The Design Expo:
work with design schools, give a topic and students create projects
last yr, How might data particularly information that makes civic society run make for a better place to live

Yo, the nonAmerican 

design of social networks the web your devices will be profoundly different in 5yrs and you will be the people who make that happen
everythin will incorporate your city's pulse

indicators of community well-being from interviews
one of the big indicators of community success is how community members are able to communicate with each other

How can you use this social networking data on a micro-scale? People need to be able to find one another and to be able to communicate (Threadbare!!! Y'all)

Not anyonymous, but vehicle for building community hub
even though twitter and webrtc and other tech exists, we do not do a good job on local communication. I don't know my local leaders. The fuck is going on! This is a gapping hole in tech that needs to be filled. The comforting looking serverâ€¦

Face to face is primary--but how do we implement tech to improve this communication
*WHOOLY*
making laten hyperlocal content 
Katie London is one of the project leaders (and she's teaching @ ITP soooo I will contact her?)

*Newspad: Collaborative News*

Project Sentient Data
Challenge: What kinds of new applications can you imagine and build when data is translated to emotion and relationships?

exploring emotions and relationships as primary vectors of engagement

[i am confused by the community discussion because i don't think any communities including the privileged should be dismissed. nor do i think we should use community as a euphemism for PoC and the poor. We see the poor as PoC. However, I do think that privilege should be made explicit, and I don't think the answer is to get a grad student to develop another nonprofit]

WHY AREN'T US PUBLIC SCHOOLS TEACHING CODE/PROGRAMMING? WHY????
*KoDo*??
a game that teaches programming, more gamified than scratch

*Spark*
