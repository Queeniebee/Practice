Experience Design: Jamaica Avenue, Queens, NY
=============================================

Because the New York Influencer panel sparked an intriguing yet at times uncomfortable conversation, I decided to share my slice of New York with my classmate. My experience design assignment was to explore Jamaica Avenue and find places on the provided "shopping list". I included prompts to locate a grocery store, children's clothing store, and hair and/or beauty supply shop. 

Though out on Long Island, my family and I traveled frequently to Jamaica Avenue when I was young. My mother would go to purchase Caribbean food items not found in the major box supermarkets dominating our suburb. August's Back-to-School time was marked by a trip to Cookie's, a popular (well, I think) children's clothing store. I still have some pieces purchased from Cookie's. Not that they fit, but despite being cheap they have lasted. Before the nearest Duane Reade carried Iman Comestics, I would spend my allowance at the Walgreens by the Jamaica Performing Arts Center. 

I return to the Jamaica Ave less often, usually to purchase my hair extensions and beauty products, like foundation and lotion. My mother still goes to shop for her essentials.

I was prompted to think about Jamaica Ave because major retail strips like it are not included in the dominant media's New York-Big-City mythology. Jamaica Ave is one example of the plurality of ethnicities that have established firm roots in the city.
