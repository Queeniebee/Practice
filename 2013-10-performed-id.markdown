Response::The World I Was Born Into
[she eats, she flips magazine pages sharp sharp sharp flip flip flip]

(I could do a video, of a woman changing, many times)
the world i was born into was an escape
an inbetween place
because you are never really home
and danger is always around the corner
danger is in the house

an inbetween place, reshape your self into another
and you’ll be ugly, lumpy ill-formed, awkward but it will be something different other than what you were.

and the point is to collect
no--to throw away
the point is to throw away
[flipping the magazine pages at a clip a rhythm emerges]

an inbetween place
the markers to ground spoil easily and so are ephermal.
colored sticks and pots and you beat yourself with it to become something different another person. another person
you’re always in the making always.

a little too late to do video for sunday, but for something later. DEFINITELY.
can be a script that I post.
